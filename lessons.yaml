  comments:
    - Sajem Tan verbs don't agree with their subjects, so for now the only conjugation you need is $fê$. What this means will become clearer soon, but for now just put it on all the verbs you learn.
    - Nouns in Sajem Tan don't have articles, so $gamyk$ can either "a tree" or "the tree", depending on context.
    - In English, the subject is before the verb and the object is after, but Sajem Tan uses the opposite order, so $Dê xanönfê do$ is "You greet me", not "I greet you".
    - $Xanönfê$ can be used by itself without a subject to mean "hi!"
  sentences:
    - $Do xanönfê gamyk$ The tree greets you
    - $Gamyk xanönfê dê$ I greet the tree
